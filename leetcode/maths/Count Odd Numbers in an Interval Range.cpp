// Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

// Example 1:

// Input: low = 3, high = 7
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
// Example 2:

// Input: low = 8, high = 10
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].

// Constraints:

// 0 <= low <= high <= 10^9

public:
    int countOdds(int low, int high)

        if (!(low & 1))

        // low could become greater than high due to incrementation
        // if it is, the answer is 0; otherwise, use the formula.
        return low > high ? 0 : (high - low) / 2 + 1;
